### Phonebook App
This application operates as a phonebook for a user. Some of the key features allow users to save a contacts name, phone number, and email address in a database. It also allows users to update and delete previously stored records.

### Check File(s) / File(s) Transfer GUI
This application allows users to select and transfer text files from one directory to another. It will also transfer files if they were modified within the past 24 hours.
